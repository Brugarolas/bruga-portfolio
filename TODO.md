# TODO
- Update experience
- Add TypeScript, Svelte and Nuxt as front-end skills, and Rust as back-end skills
- Think about adding more skills (Cypress? Travis? Github Actions?) or patterns/soft skills (TDD? BDD? etc)
- Add non-existant custom SVG icons
- Examine which Font Awesome icons are we using and add them to icon font
- Modify webfonts-loader settings to make all icons have same height and width, and be centered (both vertically and horizontally) -> https://github.com/vusion/webfonts-generator#fontname-normalize-fontheight-round-descent
