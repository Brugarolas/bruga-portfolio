# TODO
- Update experience
- Add TypeScript, Svelte and Nuxt as front-end skills, and Rust as back-end skills
- Think about adding more skills (Cypress? Travis? Github Actions?) or patterns/soft skills (TDD? BDD? etc)
- Add non-existant custom SVG icons
- Create icon font with these icons using IcoMoon App or https://github.com/tancredi/fantasticon
- Examine which Font Awesome icons are we using and add them to icon font
